# hello-world
Hello, how are ya world
I'm pretty new at coding, studying a Computer Science degree at the grand old age of 47, i just fancy doing something different, have worked in the same job for 20 years or so .. as a casino croupier and supervisor - i was doing this as well as working, then Covid took out my job.. 
Am a big lover of synths, i've made electronic music since i was a kid, on my ZX Spectum BEEPing away - the Amiga banging out the tunes on Protracker 

Love abit of Winamp Milkdrop visualisations - hopefully i can find and eventually make code for my own tripatronic lightshows 

Generative music programming
For my Eurorack

Space
Everything is a loop
From the smallest atom to our orbit around the galactic core
for i in infinity : ))
